CHOICE POINT #1: COLOR THEME
Option Chosen: A
Explanation: I chose option A for my color theme for a few reasons. First, I wanted to keep a professional look while still having school spirit. I also chose it because I genuinely like the colors and think that they go really well with my website, especially since its a website about the classes I am taking at this school. All in all, I chose option A for my color theme because I wanted to show school spirit while still keeping an organized and professional look.

NEXT QUARTER PLANNING (myclassesnextquarter.html)


My Classes for Next Quarter:
- A Block: Earth Science - 8:25 AM - 9:55 AM
- B Block: General Psychology - 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM
- C Block: English 10 - 12:15 PM - 1:45 PM 
- D Block: Spanish 2 - 1:50 PM - 3:20 PM 

Explanation: For my next quarter, I did not specifically choose my classes. They are mostly core classes with the exception of my college class. I am most looking forward to the off-block that comes with the college I am taking, but I am looking forward to learning about the natural sciences in Earth Science. I believe that the most challenging class next quarter will be either my General Psychology class or my English class because I have heard that there is a lot of reading in my college class, and English can sometimes be difficult depending on the teacher. When I have off blocks on different days I intend to do reading and other class work in them in order to be productive. These classes will help with my academic and career goals because the three core classes that I am taking will get me credits in order to graduate, and the college class I am taking will get me college credits for when I go to college. 


REFLECTION
What I Learned: To me, the Bootstrap concepts that made sense were the grid system and the prebuilt UI pieces. I would also say that the most challenging concept of Bootstrap was the responsive images because I couldn't figure out how to get the JA logo up even though I added the link and everything. I feel like my CSS customization has improved a lot because I can now style things with colors, borders, font, etc. In the future, I would most likely use JagTrack to keep my classes organized and look back on it if I ever get stuck and don't know what to type for a different assignment. Lastly, I will use this site for planning next quarter by organzing my classes and being able to look back and see what my class is.
Hours Spent: 3 Hours

EXERCISE 2: GOOGLE CALENDAR INTEGRATION


Calendar Setup:
- Did you create a new calendar or use an existing one? I created a new calendar.
- How many Canvas iCal feeds did you add? I only added 1 iCal feed.
- Did you add them individually by course or as one combined feed? I added them as one combined feed.


Reflection:
This calendar integration will help me stay organized and turn assignments in on time. I only faced a few challenges while adding this calendar into my JagTrack page. For instance, I couldn't figure out how to personally customize it, and I also had a bit of trouble trying to figure out what size the calendar needed to be. I customized the calendar by having it be in the colors of Jefferson Academy, black and gold. I personally find that the month view works best for me, especially with being in a college class because it allows me to see long-term due dates and develop a plan for how I am going to turn it in. I may add an athletic calendar so that I can keep track of when I have games, practice, or even special events like banquets.

EXERCISE 3: DARK/LIGHT MODE TOGGLE


Color Scheme Design: 
For dark mode, I used the original colors that were used for my color theme in module 1 because they were relatively dark and I thought it would be easier to create lighter colors over darker colors. For my light mode, I took the colors from dark mode and just added more white to them. My color choices reflect my style because I wanted to keep school colors to maintain a clean, spirited, professional look and the light mode still keeps school colors, but just makes them lighter than what they originally were. I personally just used a bit of contrast as my color theory principle because I took the darker color, found the contrast, and used that color. I ensured there was a good contrast for accessibility by comparing the colors side by side and seeing that there was a subtle difference between the colors, but nothing that tremendously stood out. The tools I used to help choose colors was the color pallete and w3schools. I did try a few colors that didn't work, but it was mainly colors for the text, and they didn't work because the text was too light and you couldn't see it in addition with the light background.

Theme Preferences:
- Which theme do you prefer personally and why? I personally prefer dark mode because I find it more aesthetically pleasing, and it make my head and eyes hurt way less.
- When do you think dark mode is most useful? I personally believe that dark mode is the most useful because if it is dark out and someone has light mode on, it will most likely irritate their eyes, whereas if they had dark mode on, they would be able to see things better.
- Did you create any custom CSS for the toggle button? I did not create any custom CSS for the toggle button, and just left it as a sun and moon emoji. 


JavaScript Understanding:
JavaScript adds features that allows you to interact with a website, such as drop-down menus. localStorage allows websites to store data on a user's device with no expiration date posted. It is mainly designed to store small amounts of data locally. When I click the theme toggle button, the website switches from light colors to dark colors. The time preference persists when you reload the website because it is using localStorage to save the choice of your theme locally in your browser. I might use JavaScript in future projects to build more interactive websites, games, and maybe even mobile apps.

EXERCISE 4: ABOUT ME PAGE (FINAL ASSIGNMENT)


Bootstrap Components Used:
1. Jumbotron (Hero Section) - Used for introduction at the top of the page to tell the user who I am.
2. Cards - Used for organizing information into catergories and clean boxes.
3. Badges - Used for showing my skills and interests in a way that doesn't take up too much space.
4. Buttons - Used for easy links for the user to either contact me or look at work that I am doing/done.



Design Choices: 
I mostly chose these specific Bootstrap components because they allowed me to have organization on my about me page. I decided on the layout and structure by envisioning what I believed would look best on my page and from there, took it step by step. Some challenges I faced while building this structure was the colors and some errors that came up along the way. I am most proud of the way my page looks. I believe it looks organized and appealing to the eye. This page reflects my love for my hobbies and my organization that I have. If I had more time, I would improve the colors. I ensured my page was responsive by clicking on every link, leaving the website then coming back, and refreshing the site.



Research and Problem-Solving: The resources I used were W3Schools, Web Docs, Code HS, and Color Picker. The hardest part to figure out was the bootstrap components, like how to set them up. I had one issue that I needed to troubleshoot, but I just clicked around and deleted a few things, and then it was fixed. I learned that it can take multiple sources before you have a component that actually works and is compatible with your website. My confidence has definitely grown a lot between module 1 and module 2 because at first, I had no clue what bootstrap was, and now, I know how to implement it.
[Write 4-5 sentences about your learning process: 
- What resources did you use (Bootstrap docs, W3Schools, etc.)?
- What was the hardest part to figure out?
- Did you need to troubleshoot any issues? How did you solve them?
- What did you learn about researching and implementing new components?
- How has your confidence with Bootstrap grown from Module 1 to Module 2?]
