CHOICE POINT #1: COLOR THEME
Option Chosen: A
Explanation: I chose option A for my color theme for a few reasons. First, I wanted to keep a professional look while still having school spirit. I also chose it because I genuinely like the colors and think that they go really well with my website, especially since its a website about the classes I am taking at this school. All in all, I chose option A for my color theme because I wanted to show school-spirit while still keeping an organized and professional look.
